                <h3>Riyadh</h3>
                <p><strong>Riyadh</strong> (Arabic: الرياض‎, romanized: ar-Riyāḍ, lit. 'The Gardens' [ar.riˈjaːdˤ] Najdi
                    pronunciation: [er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ]) is the capital city and seat of government of the Riyadh Province and
                    the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula and the capital governorate
                    of the Riyadh Province. Located in the center of the an-Nafud desert, on the eastern part of the
                    Najd plateau, the city sits at an average of 600 metres (2,000 ft) above sea level,[2] and receives
                    more than 16 million tourists each year, making it the 2nd most visited city in the Arab world.[3]
                    Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi
                    Arabia, 2nd most populous city in the Arab world (after Cairo), and the 38th most populous in
                    Asia.[1]

                    The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an early Arab chronicler.[4] In
                    1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring Manfuha, settled in and took control of the
                    city. Deham built a wall around the city, and the best known source of the name Riyadh is from this
                    period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn
                    Dawwas.[5] In 1744, Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah,
                    Muhammad bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as the
                    First Saudi State, came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the Second Saudi State in
                    the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign over the city was
                    disrupted by a joint Ottoman–Rashidi alliance. Finally, in the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn
                    Saud, known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and
                    consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz.[6] After this he named his
                    kingdom Saudi Arabia in September 1932[6] with Riyadh as the capital.[7]

                    Riyadh is the political and administrative centre of Saudi Arabia. The Consultative Assembly (also
                    known as the Shura or Shura Council), the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia, the King and the
                    Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia are all situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies
                    that form the core of the legal system of Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of other major and minor
                    governmental bodies are also located in Riyadh.[8] The city hosts 112 foreign embassies, most of
                    which are located in the as-Safarat district or Diplomatic Quarter (Arabic: حي السفارات‎, romanized:
                    Hayy as-Safarat, lit. 'District of Embassies') in the western reaches of the city.

                    RIyadh also holds great economic significance, as it hosts the headquarters of many banks and major
                    companies, such as the National Commercial Bank (NCB), Alinma Bank and the Saudi Arabian British
                    Bank (SABB). Highway 65, known locally as the King Fahd Road, runs through some of these important
                    centers in the city, including the King Abdullah Financial District, one of the world's largest
                    financial districts, the Faisaliyah Center and the Kingdom Center. Riyadh is one of the world's
                    fastest-growing cities in population and is home to many expatriates. Riyadh has been designated a
                    global city.[9]

                <p>
                    The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, which are overseen by the Municipality of Riyadh
                    (Arabic: أمانة الرياض‎, romanized: Amanat ar-Riyad, lit. 'Protectorate of Riyadh') headed by the
                    mayor; and the Royal Commission for Riyadh which is chaired by the Governor of the Province, Faisal
                    bin Bandar Al Saud. As of July 2020, The mayor is Faisal bin Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Ayyaf
                    Al-Muqrin.[10] Most of the population of the Riyadh Province is concentrated around Riyadh, as the
                    rest of the province is mostly desert, with few, small cities connected by small two- to four-lane
                    highways, such as Wadi ad-Dawasir.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>During the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site of modern Riyadh was called Hajr (Arabic: حجر‎), and
                    was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa.[11] Hajr served as the capital of the province
                    of Al-Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the
                    Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell
                    under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al-Kharj. The city
                    then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveler Ibn Battuta
                    wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as "the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr".
                    Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants
                    belonging to the Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform
                    the Hajj.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these
                    were Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry.
                    The earliest known reference to the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler
                    reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring
                    Manfuha, took control of Riyadh.[4] Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the various oasis
                    town in the area, making them effectively a single city. The name "Riyadh," meaning "gardens" refers
                    to these earlier oasis towns.[5]
