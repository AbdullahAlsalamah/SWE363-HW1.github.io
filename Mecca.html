                <h3>Mecca</h3>
                <p><strong>Mecca,</strong> officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat
                    al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah,[a] is the holiest city in
                    Islam and the capital of the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia.[2] The city is 70 km (43 mi) inland
                    from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded
                    population was 1,578,722 in 2015.[3] The estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making
                    it the third-most populated city in the kingdom. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year
                    during the Ḥajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dhūl-Ḥijjah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mecca is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur ("Mountain of Light") is
                    just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad.[4]
                    Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known
                    as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and
                    Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla),
                    cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.[5]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their
                    control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes,
                    which owes to its rich history. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn
                    Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and
                    infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest
                    building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has
                    also carried out a destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites,[6] such as
                    the Ajyad Fortress.[7][8][9] Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the
                    city.[10][11]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muslims from around the world visit the city, not only for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, but also
                    as tourists to visit regional landmarks such as the 'Aisha Mosque (Masjid 'Aisha) and the sites
                    visited by pilgrims in the Hajj and 'Umrah. Mecca is now home to two of the most expensive buildings
                    in the world, the Masjid al-Haram, valued at 100 billion US dollars, and the Abraj al-Bait complex,
                    valued at 15 billion US dollars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Makkah Regional Municipality, a municipal
                    council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the
                    Saudi government. As of May 2015, the mayor of the city is Dr. Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr.[12][13] The
                    City of Mecca amanah, which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the
                    Makkah Province, which includes the neighboring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if, even though Jeddah is
                    considerably larger in population compared to Mecca. The Provincial Governor of the province from 16
                    May 2007 is Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud was appointed as the new governor.[14]

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, the etymology of Makkah is
                    obscure.[15] Widely believed to be a synonym for Mecca, it is said to be more specifically the early
                    name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred
                    area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.[16][17]

                    Bakkah

                    The Qur'an refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96,

                    "Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Bakkah..." – Qur'an 3:96

                    This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic
                    tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among
                    others.[18][19][20]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of
                    Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current
                    form of the name. "Makkah" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is
                    closer to the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling
                    in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide.[21] The full official name is Makkah
                    al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the
                    Honored').[21] "Makkah" is used to refer to the city in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse
                    24.[15][23]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The word "Mecca" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of
                    people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this
                    spelling for the city as offensive.[21] Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration
                    for the Arabic name of the city,

                    The consensus in academic scholarship is that "Macoraba", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by
                    Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed but the most suitable one is that it
                    is derived from the Old South Arabian root "M-K-R-B" which means temple.[24][25]
