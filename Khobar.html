                <h3>Khobar</h3>
                <p><strong>Khobar</strong> (Arabic: ٱلْخُبَر‎, romanized: al-Khubar), is a city and governorate in the
                    Eastern Province of
                    the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf. It ranks 19th by population
                    overall in the kingdom, behind Yanbu' and ahead of Arar, with an estimated population of 165,799 as
                    of
                    2020.[1] Khobar is part of the 'Triplet Cities' area, or Dammam metropolitan area along with Dammam
                    and
                    Dhahran, forming the residential core of the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city was founded alongside Dammam by the Dawasir who moved there in 1923 fearing British
                    persecution
                    with the permission of King Abdulaziz Al Saud.[2] Khobar experienced rapid growth during and after
                    the
                    discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia as it served as the port for the oil exports of Saudi Aramco in the
                    company's early days.[2] Traditionally, Khobar has also been a city of shopkeepers and merchants,
                    and
                    today has several shopping malls in and around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is the newest in the Dammam metropolitan area, facing the Persian Gulf with its 16-km long
                    Corniche Road, which runs parallel to the city's eastern coast. Khobar is also considered a resort
                    town
                    as its southern suburbs of the city face the Half Moon Bay and host several beaches and beach
                    resorts.
                    By night, the quiet city turns into a bustling one, with some of the largest malls in the kingdom,
                    such
                    as the Mall of Dhahran and the al-Rashid Mall. The city is also home to the historic Suwaiket
                    Street,
                    officially known as the Prince Bandar ibn Abdulaziz Street, which is home to some of the oldest
                    markets
                    in the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Khobar governorate is further divided into several municipalities, with Khobar as their capital.
                    'Issam ibn Abdullatif al-Mulla has been serving as the mayor of the governorate from the Islamic
                    year
                    1428 AH.[3]
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>In the early 1930s, Khobar was mainly a fishing hamlet inhabited by members of the Dawasir tribe, who
                    moved there in 1923, fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz. The city
                    shares
                    a similar history with Dammam. The tribe settled in Khobar for its proximity to Bahrain as they had
                    hoped to return to their homeland.[2] The Khobar Governorate was incorporated in 1942 and with the
                    discovery of oil in nearby areas, a port was built in the southern parts of the modern city to
                    facilitate the export of petroleum to Bahrain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city quickly transformed into a residential hub and a commercial and industrial port. It soon
                    lost
                    these privileges as commercial operations were transferred to the King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam and
                    the
                    petroleum exports were transferred to Ra's Tanura. As a result, Khobar retained its status as the
                    residential core of the area, but over time, its streets slowly became densely packed with markets
                    Its
                    northern waterfront along the Persian Gulf has been transformed into a corniche with parks and
                    eateries,
                    with beaches and resorts to the south on Half Moon Bay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most of Khobar's districts are built upon the grid system, unlike Dammam, most of the
                    buildings in
                    the city's main districts are a mix of commercial and residential complexes, with masjids of varied
                    designs and colours adorning its many streets.
